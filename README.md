# Autism Prediction using Machine Learning

Autism is a neurological disorder that affects an individualâ€™s ability to interact socially, maintain eye contact, and engage in learning activities. It also impacts various behavioral and social capabilities.

Currently, there are no definitive diagnostic methods to determine whether a person has autism. However, machine learning presents an opportunity to bridge this gap by analyzing behavioral patterns and predicting the likelihood of autism based on data-driven insights.

This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict autism, potentially aiding early diagnosis and intervention.
